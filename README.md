The DEC112 Semantic Container is a chatbot to be used in the DEC112 system (official website: https://www.dec112.at/en). A ready to use Docker image is available on Dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/r/semcon/sc-dec112    
    
Special features include:    
* chatbot : either Eliza ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA)) or deaf emergency chat training    
* multi language support: currently text available for English, German, Spanish, French, Romanian    
* consent management: if a user consents to using chat texts and a DID featuring a service endpoint for hosting consent information (e.g., OwnYourData Data Vault, https://data-vault.eu/en) is available, then this consent information is shared (including requesting information and consent revocation)
